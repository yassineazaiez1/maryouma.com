	<p>before i met you i didn’t think love was for me it was something other people had and felt something in movies and tv shows it felt more like a wish i had than something real now that I’m with you love is so much more tangible it’s something i can reach out and touch it’s so much more than a wish or a hope (though it does give me hope for so many things) and it’s the genuine wonderful person i wake up to the warm hand next to mine the brush of hair against my cheek  i love you and i love you so much more than you because of that love i love myself and the world in a way i never thought possible you have made that possible for me You have made everything possible...</p>
